Binary heap
Priority queues

Heap can implement the priority queues in log(n)

A heap is a complete binary tree


A complete binary tree is a binary tree in which every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled
and all nodes are as far left as possible

Heap can be implemented by array

node i = a[i]
parent = a[i/2]
left child = a[2i]
right child = a[2i+1]

max heap property
parent bigger than its children (and all its descendants)
