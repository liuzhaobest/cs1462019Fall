B-Tree Tutorial - An Introduction to B-Trees
Fullstack Academy


self balance tree     1972

each node can have more than one keys

left small, mid in range, right large

a B-tree of order M
every node has at most m children
a non-leaf node with k children contains k-1 keys

the root has at least two children if it is not a leaf node

every non-leaf node(except root) has at least upperInt(m/2) children

all leaves appear in the same level



inserting
if the insert is full
split the original leaf into 2 leaves
the median will be promot to the parent


we can even create a new root node


deleting from a b tree



When B trees are useful to use 
whenever you are interfacing with some kind of external memory and the time to access
the data of a node greatly exceeds the time spent processing that data
so you can imagine that if you had millions of data points and you couldn't 
load them all into memory. maybe you just have the root node loaded into memory
and every time you want to access the children of that node you are having to read from disk and that 
operation reading from the disk takes a lot more time than much much more time maybe a hundred times
or a thousand times more than even these complicated operations moving values around
and also often used when you are doing something like reading a tip from a disk with a database
or a file system

we may want to read a bunch of information from the disk one time so we may use a b tree of 500 or more
