Memory requirements for primitive types

Boolean 1
Byte    1
char    2
int     4
float   4
double  8
object  32
non-static inner class overhead  8

for example, an array of int of length N need 24 (16 for object, 4 for size, 4 for padding) + 4N

an array of objects of N Date objects uses 24 + 8N ( reference) + 32N (for each object)

Alogrithm is any well-defined computational procedure that takes some value, as input and produces some value, or set of values as output.
