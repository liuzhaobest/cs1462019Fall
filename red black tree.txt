Example of BST

AVL trees
2-3 trees
2-3-4 trees
B-trees

red-black trees
skip lists
treaps

red black properties
1. each node is either red or black
2. the root and leaves are all black
3. every red node has black node, no two red nodes in consequence
4. all simple paths from a node x to a descendant leave of x have same number of black nodes on them.
black_height(x)
does not include x itself.



at most half of the nodes is red


height of red black tree

red-black tree with n keys has height h<=2log(n+1)
so O(logn)
